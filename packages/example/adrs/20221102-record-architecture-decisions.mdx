## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](https://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

Our architecture decisions will be recorded and displayed using the [ADR Gatsby theme](https://www.github.com/Lullabot/gatsby-theme-adr).
